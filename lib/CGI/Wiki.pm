=head1 NAME

CGI::Wiki - A toolkit for building Wikis.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Helps you develop Wikis quickly by taking care of the boring bits for
you.  You will still need to write some code - this isn't an instant Wiki.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Set up a wiki object with an SQLite storage backend, and an
  # inverted index/DB_File search backend.  This store/search
  # combination can be used on systems with no access to an actual
  # database server.

  my $store     = CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite->new(
      dbname => "/home/wiki/store.db" );
  my $indexdb   = Search::InvertedIndex::DB::DB_File_SplitHash->new(
      -map_name  => "/home/wiki/indexes.db",
      -lock_mode => "EX" );
  my $search    = CGI::Wiki::Search::SII->new(
      indexdb => $indexdb );

  my $wiki      = CGI::Wiki->new( store     => $store,
                                  search    => $search );

  # Do all the CGI stuff.
  my $q      = CGI->new;
  my $action = $q->param("action");
  my $node   = $q->param("node");

  if ($action eq 'display') {
      my $raw    = $wiki->retrieve_node($node);
      my $cooked = $wiki->format($raw);
      print_page(node    => $node,
		 content => $cooked);
  } elsif ($action eq 'preview') {
      my $submitted_content = $q->param("content");
      my $preview_html      = $wiki->format($submitted_content);
      print_editform(node    => $node,
	             content => $submitted_content,
	             preview => $preview_html);
  } elsif ($action eq 'commit') {
      my $submitted_content = $q->param("content");
      my $cksum = $q->param("checksum");
      my $written = $wiki->write_node($node, $submitted_content, $cksum);
      if ($written) {
          print_success($node);
      } else {
          handle_conflict($node, $submitted_content);
      }
  }

=item B<new>

  # Set up store, search and formatter objects.
  my $store     = CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite->new(
      dbname => "/home/wiki/store.db" );
  my $indexdb   = Search::InvertedIndex::DB::DB_File_SplitHash->new(
      -map_name  => "/home/wiki/indexes.db",
      -lock_mode => "EX" );
  my $search    = CGI::Wiki::Search::SII->new(
      indexdb => $indexdb );
  my $formatter = My::HomeMade::Formatter->new;

  my $wiki = CGI::Wiki->new(
      store     => $store,     # mandatory
      search    => $search,    # defaults to undef
      formatter => $formatter  # defaults to something suitable
  );

C<store> must be an object of type C<CGI::Wiki::Store::*> and
C<search> if supplied must be of type C<CGI::Wiki::Search::*> (though
this isn't checked yet - FIXME). If C<formatter> isn't supplied, it
defaults to an object of class L<CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default>.

You can get a searchable Wiki up and running on a system without an
actual database server by using the SQLite storage backend with the
SII/DB_File search backend - cut and paste the lines above for a quick
start, and see L<CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite>, L<CGI::Wiki::Search::SII>,
and L<Search::InvertedIndex::DB::DB_File_SplitHash> when you want to
learn the details.

C<formatter> can be any object that behaves in the right way; this
essentially means that it needs to provide a C<format> method which
takes in raw text and returns the formatted version. See
L<CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default> for a simple example. Note that you can
create a suitable object from a sub very quickly by using
L<Test::MockObject> like so:

  my $formatter = Test::MockObject->new();
  $formatter->mock( 'format', sub { my ($self, $raw) = @_;
                                    return uc( $raw );
                                  } );

I'm not sure whether to put this in the module or not - it'd let you
just supply a sub instead of an object as the formatter, but it feels
wrong to be using a Test::* module in actual code.

=item B<retrieve_node>

  # Or get additional data about the node as well.

  # Maybe we stored some of our own custom metadata too.

                                  );
  print $node{content};

In scalar context, returns the current (raw Wiki language) contents of
the specified node. In list context, returns a hash containing the
contents of the node plus additional data:

=over 4

=item B<last_modified>

=item B<version>

=item B<checksum>

=item B<metadata> - a reference to a hash containing any caller-supplied
metadata sent along the last time the node was written

=back

The C<node> parameter is mandatory. The C<version> parameter is
optional and defaults to the newest version. If the node hasn't been
created yet, it is considered to exist but be empty (this behaviour
might change).

B<Note> on metadata - each hash value is returned as an array ref,
even if that type of metadata only has one value.

sub retrieve_node {
    my ($self, @args) = @_;
    $self->store->retrieve_node( @args );
}

=item B<verify_checksum>

  my $ok = $wiki->verify_checksum($node, $checksum);

Sees whether your checksum is current for the given node. Returns true
if so, false if not.

B<NOTE:> Be aware that when called directly and without locking, this
might not be accurate, since there is a small window between the
checking and the returning where the node might be changed, so
B<don't> rely on it for safe commits; use C<write_node> for that. It
can however be useful when previewing edits, for example.

=cut

sub verify_checksum {

=cut

sub list_backlinks {

}

=item B<list_dangling_links>

  # List all nodes that have been linked to from other nodes but don't
  # yet exist.
  my @links = $wiki->list_dangling_links;

Each node is returned once only, regardless of how many other nodes
link to it.

=cut

    $self->store->list_dangling_links( @args );
}

=item B<list_all_nodes>

  my @nodes = $wiki->list_all_nodes;

Returns a list containing the name of every existing node.  The list
won't be in any kind of order; do any sorting in your calling script.

=cut

sub list_all_nodes {
    my ($self, @args) = @_;
    $self->store->list_all_nodes( @args );

=item B<list_nodes_by_metadata>

  # All documentation nodes.
  my @nodes = $wiki->list_nodes_by_metadata(
      metadata_type  => "category",
      metadata_value => "documentation",
      ignore_case    => 1,   # optional but recommended (see below)
  );

  # All pubs in Hammersmith.
  my @pubs = $wiki->list_nodes_by_metadata(
      metadata_type  => "category",
      metadata_value => "Pub",
  );
  my @hsm  = $wiki->list_nodes_by_metadata(
      metadata_type  => "category",
      metadata_value  => "Hammersmith",
  );
  my @results = my_l33t_method_for_ANDing_arrays( \@pubs, \@hsm );

Returns a list containing the name of every node whose caller-supplied
metadata matches the criteria given in the parameters.

By default, the case-sensitivity of both C<metadata_type> and
C<metadata_value> depends on your database - if it will return rows
with an attribute value of "Pubs" when you asked for "pubs", or not.
If you supply a true value to the C<ignore_case> parameter, then you
can be sure of its being case-insensitive.  This is recommended.

If you don't supply any criteria then you'll get an empty list.

This is a really really really simple way of finding things; if you
want to be more complicated then you'll need to call the method
multiple times and combine the results yourself, or write a plugin.

  my @nodes = $wiki->list_recent_changes(
      last_n_changes => 5,
      metadata_wasnt  => { edit_type => "Minor tidying" }
  );

You I<must> supply one of the following constraints: C<days>
(integer), C<since> (epoch), C<last_n_changes> (integer). You I<may> also
supply one of the following constraints: C<metadata_is>,
C<metadata_isnt>, C<metadata_was>, C<metadata_wasnt>. Each should be a
ref to a hash with a single key and value.

C<metadata_is> and C<metadata_isnt> look only at the metadata that the
node I<currently> has. C<metadata_was> and C<metadata_wasnt> also take
into account the metadata of previous versions of a node. B<NOTE:> If
you supply either or both of C<metadata_was> and C<metadata_wasnt>
then any C<metadata_is> and C<metadata_isnt> will be ignored.

Returns results as an array, in reverse chronological order.  Each
element of the array is a reference to a hash with the following entries:

=over 4

=item * B<name>: the name of the node

=item * B<version>: the latest version number

=item * B<last_modified>: the timestamp of when it was last modified

=item * B<metadata>: a ref to a hash containing any metadata attached
to the current version of the node

=back

Unless you supply C<metadata_was> or C<metadata_wasnt>, each node will
only be returned once, regardless of how many times it has been
changed recently.

  if ( $wiki->node_exists( "Wombat Defenestration" ) {
      # do something about the weird people infesting your wiki
  } else {
      # ah, safe, no weirdos here
  }

Returns true if the node has ever been created (even if it is
currently empty), and false otherwise.

sub node_exists {
    my ($self, @args) = @_;
    $self->store->node_exists( @args );
}

=item B<delete_node>

  $wiki->delete_node($node);

Deletes the node completely, including removing all its history. 
Doesn't do any locking though - to fix? You probably don't want to let
anyone except Wiki admins call this. You may not want to use it at
all.

Croaks on error, silently does nothing if the node doesn't exist,
returns true if no error.

}

=item B<search_nodes>

  # Find all the nodes which contain the word 'expert'.
  my %results = $wiki->search_nodes('expert');

Returns a (possibly empty) hash whose keys are the node names and
whose values are the scores in some kind of relevance-scoring system I
haven't entirely come up with yet. For OR searches, this could
initially be the number of terms that appear in the node, perhaps.

Defaults to AND searches (if $and_or is not supplied, or is anything
other than C<OR> or C<or>).

Searches are case-insensitive.

Croaks if you haven't defined a search backend.

=cut

sub search_nodes {

=item B<supports_phrase_searches>

=item B<supports_fuzzy_searches>

  if ( $wiki->supports_fuzzy_searches ) {

Returns true if your chosen search backend supports fuzzy title searching,
and false otherwise.

    my ($self, @args) = @_;
    $self->search_obj->supports_fuzzy_searches( @args ) if $self->search_obj;
}

=item B<fuzzy_title_match>

B<NOTE:> This section of the documentation assumes you are using a
search engine which supports fuzzy matching. (See above.) The 
L<CGI::Wiki::Search::DBIxFTS> backend in particular does not.

  $wiki->write_node( "King's Cross St Pancras", "A station." );
  my %matches = $wiki->fuzzy_title_match( "Kings Cross St. Pancras" );

Returns a (possibly empty) hash whose keys are the node names and
whose values are the scores in some kind of relevance-scoring system I
haven't entirely come up with yet.

Note that even if an exact match is found, any other similar enough
matches will also be returned. However, any exact match is guaranteed
to have the highest relevance score.

The matching is done against "canonicalised" forms of the search
string and the node titles in the database: stripping vowels, repeated
letters and non-word characters, and lowercasing.

Croaks if you haven't defined a search backend.

=cut

sub fuzzy_title_match {
    my ($self, @args) = @_;
    if ( $self->search_obj ) {

}

=item B<register_plugin>

  my $plugin = CGI::Wiki::Plugin::Foo->new;
  $wiki->register_plugin( plugin => $plugin );

Registers the plugin with the wiki as one that needs to be informed
when we write a node.

If the plugin C<isa> L<CGI::Wiki::Plugin>, calls the methods set up by
that parent class to let it know about the backend store, search and
formatter objects.

Finally, calls the plugin class's C<on_register> method, which should
be used to check tables are set up etc. Note that because of the order
these things are done in, C<on_register> for L<CGI::Wiki::Plugin>
subclasses can use the C<datastore>, C<indexer> and C<formatter>
methods as it needs to.

    my ($self, %args) = @_;
    my $plugin = $args{plugin} || "";

    }
    push @{ $self->{_registered_plugins} }, $plugin;
}

=item B<get_registered_plugins>

  my @plugins = $wiki->get_registered_plugins;

Returns an array of plugin objects.

sub get_registered_plugins {
    my $self = shift;
    my $ref = $self->{_registered_plugins};
    return wantarray ? @$ref : $ref;
}

=item B<write_node>

  my $written = $wiki->write_node($node, $content, $checksum, \%metadata);
  if ($written) {
      display_node($node);
  } else {
      handle_conflict();
  }

Writes the specified content into the specified node in the backend
storage; and indexes/reindexes the node in the search indexes (if a
search is set up); calls C<post_write> on any registered plugins.

Note that you can blank out a node without deleting it by passing the
empty string as $content, if you want to.

If you expect the node to already exist, you must supply a checksum,
and the node is write-locked until either your checksum has been
proved old, or your checksum has been accepted and your change
committed.  If no checksum is supplied, and the node is found to
already exist and be nonempty, a conflict will be raised.

The first two parameters are mandatory, the others optional. If you
want to supply metadata but have no checksum (for a newly-created
node), supply a checksum of C<undef>.

Returns 1 on success, 0 on conflict, croaks on error.

B<Note> on the metadata hashref: Any data in here that you wish to
access directly later must be a key-value pair in which the value is
either a scalar or a reference to an array of scalars.  For example:

  $wiki->write_node( "Calthorpe Arms", "nice pub", $checksum,
                     { category => [ "Pubs", "Bloomsbury" ],
                       postcode => "WC1X 8JR" } );

  # and later

  my @nodes = $wiki->list_nodes_by_metadata(
      metadata_type  => "category",
      metadata_value => "Pubs"             );

For more advanced usage (passing data through to registered plugins)
you may if you wish pass key-value pairs in which the value is a
hashref or an array of hashrefs. The data in the hashrefs will not be
stored as metadata; it will be checksummed and the checksum will be
stored instead. Such data can I<only> be accessed via plugins.

For a very quick Wiki startup without any of that icky programming
stuff, see Tom Insam's L<CGI::Wiki::Kwiki>, an instant wiki based on
CGI::Wiki.

Or for the specialised application of a wiki about a city, see the
L<OpenGuides> distribution.

L<CGI::Wiki> allows you to use different formatting modules. 
L<Text::WikiFormat> might be useful for anyone wanting to write a
custom formatter. Existing formatters include:

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default> (in this distro)

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Pod>

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Formatter::UseMod>

=back

There's currently a choice of three storage backends - all
database-backed.

=over 4

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Store::MySQL> (in this distro)

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Store::Pg> (in this distro)

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Store::SQLite> (in this distro)

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Store::Database> (parent class for the above - in this distro)

=back

A search backend is optional:

=over 4

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Search::DBIxFTS> (in this distro, uses L<DBIx::FullTextSearch>)

=item * L<CGI::Wiki::Search::SII> (in this distro, uses L<Search::InvertedIndex>)

=back

Standalone plugins can also be written - currently they should only
read from the backend storage, but write access guidelines are coming
soon. Plugins written so far and available from CPAN:

=head1 FEEDBACK

Please send me mail and tell me what you think of this, particularly
if something is broken or confusing. I would much rather fix it than
not know. I love getting mail, even if all it says is "I used your
thing and I like it", or "I didn't use your thing because of X".

=head1 CREDITS

Various London.pm types helped out with code review, encouragement,
JFDI, style advice, code snippets, module recommendations, and so on;
far too many to name individually, but particularly Richard Clamp,
Tony Fisher, Mark Fowler, and Chris Ball.

blair christensen sent patches and gave me some good ideas. chromatic
continues to patiently apply my patches to L<Text::WikiFormat> and
help me get it working in just the way I need. Paul Makepeace helped
me add support for connecting to non-local databases. Shevek has been
prodding me a lot lately. The L<OpenGuides> team keep me well-supplied
with encouragement and bug reports.

=head1 GRATUITOUS PLUG

I'm only obsessed with Wikis because of the Open Guide to London --
