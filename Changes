0.02    ? November 2002
        Pulled out the database setup stuff into modules (Mark Fowler
          did most of this bit, thanks).
        Added recent_changes method and its tests, changed the example
          wiki to show how this can be used.
        Renamed some tests since the order they're run in matters now.
        Added better support for noninteractive installation (with help
          from Mark again).

0.01    28 October 2002
