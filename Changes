        I'd uploaded an unfinished version by mistake.  One day I will figure
          out how to do this upload thing without screwing up.

        Added a DBD::SQLite storage backend (thanks to blair christensen
          for a patch that makes up part of this).
        Added tests and docs for retrieval of old versions of pages
          (bad Kake, should have written those before implementing the
           feature; blair and Richard shamed me into getting it sorted now).
        retrieve_node_and_checksum is now deprecated -- retrieve_node is
          more clever and will return content only or a hash with content
          plus meta-data, according to context.  So you should get at the
          checksum via that.
        user-setup-postgres.pl was buggy, fixed now.
        Only two beer rewards now remain.

        Forgot to regenerate and add the README (I've put it in the
        MANIFEST now to stop that happening again).  Also forgot to
        mention that I've upped the bribe.

        Pulled out the database setup stuff into modules (Mark Fowler
          did most of this bit, thanks).
        Added recent_changes method and its tests, changed the example
          wiki to show how this can be used.
        Renamed some tests since the order they're run in matters now.
        Added better support for noninteractive installation (with help
          from Mark again).

0.01    28 October 2002
        Initial release.
