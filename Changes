0.14    3 January 2003
        Added $store->node_exists method and tests.
        Amended $store->list_recent_changes to take a 'last_n_changes'
          parameter, so you can find the last 10 (or whatever) nodes edited.
        Made an internal change to the way ->format is delegated to the
          formatter object, to give said object access to the store.

0.13    2 January 2003
        Minor fix - t/031_formatting.t was being reported as failing on
          systems without support for any of the backends, since I forgot to
          update the SKIP condition when I added six extra tests.  Thanks
          to root@ostend.org for the report via cpan-testers.

        The Search::InvertedIndex backend wasn't indexing the node titles -
          fixed and added tests.
        Added tests for non-MySQL Search::InvertedIndex backends and fixed
          CGI::Wiki::Search::SII to be case-insensitive all the time (instead
          of just when using MySQL).
        Tweaked the documentation some more - offers to simplify the docs
          and/or write a tutorial would be greatly appreciated.

0.11    31 December 2002
        Changes suggested by blair christensen, to allow alternate formatters.
        See the README for details and CGI::Wiki::Formatter::Default for an
          example.
        Took out some leftover debug stuff from CGI::Wiki::Search::SII.

0.10    19 December 2002
        Added a Search::InvertedIndex backend; currently only tested with
          the MySQL version of Search::InvertedIndex.  When running make test,
          if the Search::InvertedIndex tests are being run, the following tests
          will warn 'testdb is not open. Can't lock.' (but should pass):
            005_setup_mysql_search_invertedindex.t
            011_cgi_wiki.t

        *** NOTE INTERFACE CHANGE ****
        Cleaned up the initialisation of the Wiki object, at the expense of
          a small interface change - you now need to create your store and
          (optional) search objects yourself and pass them as arguments
          to CGI::Wiki->new - read 'perldoc CGI::Wiki' (once installed)
          for details, or see examples/wiki.cgi in the tarball.

        I'd uploaded an unfinished version by mistake.  One day I will figure
          out how to do this upload thing without screwing up.

0.04    17 November 2002
        Added a DBD::SQLite storage backend (thanks to blair christensen
          for a patch that makes up part of this).
        Added tests and docs for retrieval of old versions of pages
          (bad Kake, should have written those before implementing the
           feature; blair and Richard shamed me into getting it sorted now).
        retrieve_node_and_checksum is now deprecated -- retrieve_node is
          more clever and will return content only or a hash with content
          plus meta-data, according to context.  So you should get at the
          checksum via that.
        user-setup-postgres.pl was buggy, fixed now.
        Only two beer rewards now remain.

0.03    9 November 2002
        Forgot to regenerate and add the README (I've put it in the
        MANIFEST now to stop that happening again).  Also forgot to
        mention that I've upped the bribe.

0.02    9 November 2002
        Pulled out the database setup stuff into modules (Mark Fowler
          did most of this bit, thanks).
        Added recent_changes method and its tests, changed the example
          wiki to show how this can be used.
        Renamed some tests since the order they're run in matters now.
        Added better support for noninteractive installation (with help
          from Mark again).

0.01    28 October 2002
        Initial release.
