HOW TO INSTALL THIS:

  Mostly the same as usual; see 'perldoc perlmodinstall' if you're stuck.

  'perl Makefile.PL' will ask you a few questions about which databases 
  it can use for testing - the default is to only test what it can get 
  away without databases for.  It is recommended that you test with as 
  many backend combinations as your system will allow. 

  Second and subsequent successful runs of 'perl Makefile.PL' will use
  the testing setup specified in the first run.  To over-ride this, do
  'perl Makefile.PL -s'

  Better support for noninteractive installation has been requested; I'm
  working on it, but patches are welcome.

POST INSTALL:

  You'll want to run one or all of the bin/user-setup-* scripts (edit the
  database name, user and password parameters in them first) to set
  up the database tables.  Maybe somebody will be nice and send me patches
  to make this work more neatly.

TESTING NOTES:

  'perl Makefile.PL' will ask some questions about which backends to run
  the tests for. You will need to create at least one test database
  before you run the tests, and your test user will need to be able to
  create and drop tables in that database.

Postgres notes:

  You can create a database from the shell:
  shell$ createdb cgi_wiki_test

  And give a user password access by editing pg_hba.conf (which lives
  somewhere like /var/lib/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf) to contain the line:

  local        cgi_wiki_test                            md5

  Then in psql run something like:
  postgres=# create user wiki with password 'wiki';

  You can give a database to a user by using psql to update the
  pg_database table -- the datdba UID comes from the pg_user table.)

MySQL notes:

  Something like "grant all privileges on cgi_wiki_test.* to
  wiki@localhost identified by 'wiki'" will create a suitable user and
  give it password access to, and all required privileges on the test
  database.
