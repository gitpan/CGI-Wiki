- Enhance CGI::Wiki::TestConfig::Utilities; make all the core CGI::Wiki
  tests use it, give it a method for returning names of temporary files
  used so we can put them in our Makefile.PLs for cleanup.

- Stemming and phrase searches for the Search::InvertedIndex backends.

- Add plugin support - see my use.perl journal or the grubstreet archives.

- The instructions in INSTALL are pretty complicated.  An easier procedure
  or better docs would be good.

- Consolidate the test data into a single file, call $dbh->quote on it
  within the setup tests.

- Look at case-sensitivity in node names.

- The formatting string for the modification time is now visible as
  $CGI::Wiki::Store::Database::timestamp_fmt -- I did this to make testing
  easier, should now think about the implications of it and consider
  documenting it.
