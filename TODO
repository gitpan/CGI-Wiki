- Write some stuff to take advantage of the tables having timestamps and
  version numbers in.  Need tests to make sure that the versioning data
  is actually going in properly.  Can do shiny things like RecentChanges
  and reversion to previous versions with this data; I just haven't taken
  the time to write them yet, and I don't expect them to be difficult.

- A non-database store option would be nice, as would a search for the
  postgres-based store.

- Look at case-sensitivity in node names.
