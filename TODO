- Stemming and phrase searches for the Search::InvertedIndex backends.

- Add plugin support - see my use.perl journal or the grubstreet archives.

- Make the macro feature more powerful.  blair christensen pointed me
  at PhpWiki's "plugin" functionality, which looks very cool.

- The instructions in INSTALL are pretty complicated.  An easier procedure
  or better docs would be good.

- Consolidate the user-setup-* scripts into a single one for all database
  backends, with an extra option for the type of store to set up.

- Consolidate the test data into a single file, call $dbh->quote on it
  within the setup tests.

- Look at case-sensitivity in node names.

- The formatting string for the modification time is now visible as
  $CGI::Wiki::Store::Database::timestamp_fmt -- I did this to make testing
  easier, should now think about the implications of it and consider
  documenting it.

- Make a usemod flatfile backend, or write a script to convert to and
  from that format.
  This is now low priority, can use Ivor's wikihoover script to copy
  a usemod-based wiki over to a CGI::Wiki based one.  See
    http://hummous.earth.li/pipermail/grubstreet/2003-January/000199.html
  for the script, and
    http://the.earth.li/~kake/cgi-bin/cgi-wiki/wiki.cgi
  for an (incomplete at time of writing) usemod emulation.
