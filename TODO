- Stemming for the Search::InvertedIndex backends.

- The instructions in INSTALL are pretty complicated.  An easier procedure
  or better docs would be good.

- The formatting string for the modification time is now visible as
  $CGI::Wiki::Store::Database::timestamp_fmt -- I did this to make testing
  easier, should now think about the implications of it and consider
  documenting it.

- Consolidate the user-setup-* scripts into a single one for all database
  backends, with an extra option for the type of store to set up.

- Consolidate the test data into a single file, call $dbh->quote on it
  within the setup tests.

- Make a usemod flatfile backend, or write a script to convert to and
  from that format.

- Look at case-sensitivity in node names.

- Make the macro feature more powerful.  blair christensen pointed me
  at PhpWiki's "plugin" functionality, which looks very cool.
