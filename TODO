- The instructions in INSTALL are pretty complicated.  An easier procedure
  or better docs would be good.

- Change retrieve_node and retrieve_node_and_checksum so they can return
  metadata like last_modified as well as the actual content.

- The modification times are stored in the database as date types -- this
  is a bit of a pain though since I need to generate a timestamp when
  storing things, and when I'm retrieving them I'm stuck with the way
  that the database outputs it unless I munge it myself.  But there would be
  portability issues (eg if moving the data to a machine with a different
  timezone or epoch) if I just stored the number of seconds since the
  epoch, as an integer.  This isn't really a TODO item, actually, it's
  more of a wonder and a babble.

- I need more tests for the version and last_modified data being stored
  and retrieved properly.

- A non-database store option would be nice, as would a search for the
  postgres-based store.

- Look at case-sensitivity in node names.

- Make the macro feature more powerful so you can do eg
    @IMAGE http://www.earth.li/~kake/Images/kateweb.gif
  and it'll inline it.
